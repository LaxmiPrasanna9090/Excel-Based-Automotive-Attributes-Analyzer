Project Overview:

This project, titled "Excel-Based Automotive Data Analyzer," focuses on analyzing a real-world used car dataset using Microsoft Excel. The dataset comprises over 9,500 records with details like brand, model, manufacturing year, fuel type, transmission, ownership, mileage, and price. The primary goal was to extract meaningful insights to assist car dealerships in understanding vehicle trends, pricing behavior, and customer preferences.

Key Excel tools such as Pivot Tables, VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, and Conditional Formatting were used to summarize data, perform lookups, compare models, and highlight outliers. Pivot Tables helped analyze model popularity, fuel type vs. transmission trends, and average age per brand. Lookup functions simulated CRM-like queries such as retrieving model, fuel type, or price by customer ID or variant.

Challenges Faced:

Data Cleaning: Many columns like AskPrice and kmDriven had non-numeric characters (â‚¹, commas, "km") which required conversion to numeric format for analysis.

Inconsistent Entries: Variations in brand/model names (e.g., spelling or case issues) needed standardization.

Lookup Limitations: VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP are limited to fixed directions, requiring extra columns or data reshaping.

Pivot Table Design: Choosing the right row/column/value combinations took iteration for meaningful visualizations.

Despite these, the project successfully delivered actionable insights using only Excel.
